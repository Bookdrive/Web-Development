    <p>One important thing here, there are many, many frameworks out there and you don’t need to learn them all. Choose
        one and start there, make a good choice, take one of the most popular frameworks out there, and master it.
        Perhaps you don’t like it, that’s alright, pick another and switch, but don’t try to learn at the beginning of
        all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of these frameworks are like a programming language on its own as they provide very specific ways to get
        things done. It may take some time to get used to them, but once you do, your productivity will boost.
