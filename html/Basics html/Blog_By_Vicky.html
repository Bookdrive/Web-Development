            <P>Getting started into programming can be very scary, and there are a lot of misconceptions out there that
                make
                people think that programming is a skill they could never learn, or that landing a job as a web
                developer is
                almost mission impossible. They couldn&apos;t be more wrong!</P>
            <p>The software development industry, web development in particular is full of amazing stories of people
                with no
                tech background who switched to development and changed their life for great and they couldn’t be
                happier
                with
                the change.</p>
            <p>Programming is a great skill to have, it will teach you to think differently, it will open you the doors
                to a
                lot
                of job opportunities even in these times where the job market is so hurt by the economic decline, and it
                will
                also give you an amazing talent to build your own projects and companies.</p>
            <p>
                I&apos;m a self-taught developer, I tried college a few times a few years ago, to never succeed there, I
                was
                always
                getting bored at the classrooms and it just wasn’t for me. However thanks to the amazing world of the
                internet I
                was able to learn all my skills and become a great software engineer. As a side note here, today I’m
                completing
                my degree at an online university, not because I needed it to get a job in tech, or because it was
                limiting
                my
                career in any way, but because it&apos;s a personal debt I want to pay off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Going back to our topic here, let me present you my path to becoming a web developer, in particular, a
                front
                end
                developer (if you don&apos;t know what this is, stay with me, I’ll explain it all), and my path to
                landing
                your
                first
                job in tech.

            <h2>What is web developer</h2>
            <p>Congrats! You decided to stay here, that means that you took the first step into becoming a web
                developer,
                but
                what exactly does it mean to be a web developer?
            </p>
            <p>
                I don&apos;t want to be so obvious here, but a web developer is he/she who utilizes a programming
                language
                to
                build
                web pages and applications. There are 3 types of web developers out there, front-end developers,
                back-end
                developers, and full-stack developers.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Front-end developer</h2>
            <p>
                A front-end developer is responsible for building what you see and interact with on a web page or
                application.
                It is the specialist who transforms a design, an image, or an idea into the code that allows web
                browsers to
                display the website. We shouldn&apos;t underestimate the work front-end developers do, as a matter of
                fact as
                web
                applications are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, the job of the front-end developer has been
                mutating
                from simply working on implementing the design to actually building full working applications which run
                within
                our browsers. This is for me a key role where you can combine tech, development, and design to build
                amazing
                experiences, and it is my recommendation for those getting started. Starting in front-end would be an
                easier
                road than if you start in back-end.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Back-end developer</h2>
            <p>
                This role is responsible for designing and building the systems that will support our front-end
                application.
                For
                example, when you click the “save” button, the back-end developer will write with code the algorithms
                and
                logic
                responsible for receiving your request, process it, store it in a database (if required) and send back
                the
                results so that the front-end can let you know it all went good.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Full-stack developer</h2>
            <p>
                It is a new term for an old role, the full-stack developer is someone who can work both, front-end and
                back-end
                tasks.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                Let&apos;s now jump into the steps that you need to become a front-end developer and land your first
                job.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the steps I’m providing here and my recommendations are what I gather from years in the industry as
                a
                developer myself, working as a tech lead for a big multinational company where I interviewed many many
                candidates and now in my role as a senior software engineer and content creator.
